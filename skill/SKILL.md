Designs and iterates production-grade frontend interfaces. Real working code, committed design choices, exceptional craft.

## Setup

Before any design work or file edits:

1. Load context (PRODUCT.md / DESIGN.md) via the loader script.
2. Identify the register and load the matching register reference (brand.md or product.md).
3. **If the user invoked a sub-command (e.g. `craft`, `shape`, `audit`), load its reference file too.** This is non-negotiable: `craft` without `craft.md` loaded means you'll skip the shape-and-confirm step the user expects.

Skipping these produces generic output that ignores the project.

### 1. Context gathering

Two files, case-insensitive. The loader looks at the project root by default and falls back to `.agents/context/` and `docs/` if the root is clean. Override with `IMPECCABLE_CONTEXT_DIR=path/to/dir` (absolute or relative to cwd).

- **PRODUCT.md**: required. Users, brand, tone, anti-references, strategic principles.
- **DESIGN.md**: optional, strongly recommended. Colors, typography, elevation, components.

Load both in one call:

```bash
node {{scripts_path}}/load-context.mjs
```

Consume the full JSON output. Never pipe through `head`, `tail`, `grep`, or `jq`. The output's `contextDir` field tells you where the files were resolved from.

If the output is already in this session's conversation history, don't re-run. Exceptions requiring a fresh load: you just ran `{{command_prefix}}impeccable teach` or `{{command_prefix}}impeccable document` (they rewrite the files), or the user manually edited one.

`{{command_prefix}}impeccable live` already warms context via `live.mjs`. If you've run `live.mjs`, don't also run `load-context.mjs` this session.

If PRODUCT.md is missing, empty, or placeholder (`[TODO]` markers, <200 chars): run `{{command_prefix}}impeccable teach`, then resume the user's original task with the fresh context. If the original task was `{{command_prefix}}impeccable craft`, resume into `{{command_prefix}}impeccable shape` before any implementation work.

If DESIGN.md is missing: nudge once per session (*"Run `{{command_prefix}}impeccable document` for more on-brand output"*), then proceed.

### 2. Register

Every design task is **brand** (marketing, landing, campaign, long-form content, portfolio: design IS the product) or **product** (app UI, admin, dashboard, tool: design SERVES the product).

Identify before designing. Priority: (1) cue in the task itself ("landing page" vs "dashboard"); (2) the surface in focus (the page, file, or route being worked on); (3) `register` field in PRODUCT.md. First match wins.

If PRODUCT.md lacks the `register` field (legacy), infer it once from its "Users" and "Product Purpose" sections, then cache the inferred value for the session. Suggest the user run `{{command_prefix}}impeccable teach` to add the field explicitly.

Load the matching reference: [reference/brand.md](reference/brand.md) or [reference/product.md](reference/product.md). The shared design laws below apply to both.

## Shared design laws

Apply to every design, both registers. Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision: maximalism needs elaborate code, minimalism needs precision. Interpret creatively. Vary across projects; never converge on the same choices. {{model}} is capable of extraordinary work. Don't hold back.

### Color

- Use OKLCH. Reduce chroma as lightness approaches 0 or 100; high chroma at extremes looks garish.
- **The cream / sand / beige body bg is the saturated AI default of 2026.** The whole warm-neutral band — OKLCH L 0.84-0.97, C < 0.06, hue 40-100 — reads as cream/sand/paper/parchment regardless of what you call it. Token names like `--paper`, `--cream`, `--sand`, `--bone`, `--flour`, `--linen`, `--parchment`, `--wheat`, `--biscuit`, `--ivory` are tells in themselves. If the brief is "warm, traditional, family-coastal-Italian" or "magazine-warm" or "editorial-restraint", DO NOT translate that into a near-white warm-tinted bg — that's the AI move. Pick: (a) a saturated brand color as the body (terracotta, oxblood, deep ochre, near-black), (b) a true off-white at chroma 0 (or chroma toward the brand's own hue, not toward warmth-by-default), or (c) a darker mid-tone tinted neutral that's clearly the brand's own. "Warmth" in the brand is carried by accent + typography + imagery, not by body bg.
- Pick a **color strategy** before picking colors. Four steps on the commitment axis:
  - **Restrained**: tinted neutrals + one accent ≤10%. Product default; brand minimalism.
  - **Committed**: one saturated color carries 30–60% of the surface. Brand default for identity-driven pages.
  - **Full palette**: 3–4 named roles, each used deliberately. Brand campaigns; product data viz.
  - **Drenched**: the surface IS the color. Brand heroes, campaign pages.
- The "one accent ≤10%" rule is Restrained only. Committed / Full palette / Drenched exceed it on purpose. Don't collapse every design to Restrained by reflex.
- **Verify contrast.** Body text must hit ≥4.5:1 against its background; large text (≥18px or bold ≥14px) needs ≥3:1. The most common failure: muted gray body text on a tinted near-white. If the contrast is even close, bump the body color toward the ink end of the ramp — light gray "for elegance" is the single biggest reason AI designs feel hard to read.

### Theme

Dark vs. light is never a default. Not dark "because tools look cool dark." Not light "to be safe."

Before choosing, write one sentence of physical scene: who uses this, where, under what ambient light, in what mood. If the sentence doesn't force the answer, it's not concrete enough. Add detail until it does.

"Observability dashboard" does not force an answer. "SRE glancing at incident severity on a 27-inch monitor at 2am in a dim room" does. Run the sentence, not the category.

### Typography

- Cap body line length at 65–75ch.
- Hierarchy through scale + weight contrast (≥1.25 ratio between steps). Avoid flat scales.
- Cap font-family count at 3 (display + body + optional mono). More than 3 reads as indecision, not richness. One well-tuned family with weight contrast usually beats three competing typefaces.
- No all-caps body copy. Reserve uppercase for short labels (≤4 words), section eyebrows (used sparingly per the Absolute bans), and badges. Sentences in ALL CAPS are unreadable at body sizes.
- Hero / display heading ceiling: clamp() max ≤ 6rem (~96px). Above that the page is shouting, not designing.
- Display heading letter-spacing floor: ≥ -0.04em. Anything tighter and letters touch — cramped, not "designed".

<codex>
Two hard typographic ceilings you currently miss:
- Hero clamp() max ≤ 6rem. 8–11rem (128–176px) reads as comically loud, not bold.
- Display letter-spacing ≥ -0.04em. Your default of -0.05 to -0.085em on display H1s makes the letters touch and reads as cramped. -0.02 to -0.03em is plenty for tight grotesque display; -0.04em is the floor.
</codex>

### Layout

- Vary spacing for rhythm. Same padding everywhere is monotony.
- Cards are the lazy answer. Use them only when they're truly the best affordance. Nested cards are always wrong.
- Don't wrap everything in a container. Most things don't need one.

### Motion

- Don't animate CSS layout properties.
- Ease out with exponential curves (ease-out-quart / quint / expo). No bounce, no elastic.

<gemini>
**Gemini-specific defect.** Adding superfluous `:hover` transforms to images (`transform: scale(1.02-1.05)` or `rotate(N deg)` on `<img>` elements) is your most common motion tell. Hover effects on images add no real information; the image isn't an action target. Don't add image-hover transforms by reflex. If a card containing an image needs hover feedback, animate the card chrome (subtle elevation, border treatment), not the image inside it.
</gemini>

### Absolute bans

Match-and-refuse. If you're about to write any of these, rewrite the element with different structure.

- **Side-stripe borders.** `border-left` or `border-right` greater than 1px as a colored accent on cards, list items, callouts, or alerts. Never intentional. Rewrite with full borders, background tints, leading numbers/icons, or nothing.
- **Gradient text.** `background-clip: text` combined with a gradient background. Decorative, never meaningful. Use a single solid color. Emphasis via weight or size.
- **Glassmorphism as default.** Blurs and glass cards used decoratively. Rare and purposeful, or nothing.
- **The hero-metric template.** Big number, small label, supporting stats, gradient accent. SaaS cliché.
- **Identical card grids.** Same-sized cards with icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly.
- **Modal as first thought.** Modals are usually laziness. Exhaust inline / progressive alternatives first.
- **Tiny uppercase tracked eyebrow above every section.** The 2023-era kicker (small all-caps text with wide tracking, "ABOUT" "PROCESS" "PRICING" above each heading) is now the saturated AI scaffold — it appears on 55-95% of generations regardless of brief, which is the definition of a tell. One named kicker as a deliberate brand system is voice; an eyebrow on every section is AI grammar. Choose a different cadence.
- **Numbered section markers (01 / 02 / 03).** Section labels as numbered display digits is the same trope, one tier deeper. If you find yourself reaching for them, you're scaffolding by reflex.
- **Text that overflows its container.** Long heading words plus large clamp scales plus narrow grids cause headline overflow on tablet/mobile. Test the heading copy at every breakpoint; if it overflows, reduce the clamp max or rewrite the copy. The viewport is part of the design.

<codex>
**Codex-specific defects** (your most-frequent giveaways — refuse-and-rewrite):

- **`border: 1px solid X` + `box-shadow: 0 Npx Mpx ...` with M ≥ 16px** on the same element. The "ghost-card" pattern — 1px border plus soft wide drop shadow on buttons and cards. Don't pair them. Pick one (a single solid border at the brand color, OR a defined shadow at no more than 8px blur), never both as decoration.
- **`border-radius: 32px+` on cards / sections / inputs.** You over-round. Cards top out at 12–16px; full-pill is fine for tags/buttons. Picking 24/28/32/40px on a card is the codex tell — no brand wants "insanely rounded".
- **Hand-drawn / sketchy SVG illustrations.** Class names like `loose-sketch`, `*-sketch`, `doodle`, `wavy`; `feTurbulence` / `feDisplacementMap` "paper grain" filters; 5-to-30 path crude scenes meant to depict a tangible subject (an otter, a table-and-fork, an album cover). All of these read as amateurish, not whimsical. If you can't render the scene with real assets, ship no illustration. Don't attempt sketchy SVG as a fallback.
- **`repeating-linear-gradient(...)` stripe backgrounds.** Diagonal stripes in `body:before` or section backgrounds are pure codex decoration. Don't.
- **"X theater" / "actually X" / "not just X, it's Y" copy.** "Productivity theater", "engagement theater", "growth theater": instant AI slop. Choose a specific noun, not a meta-criticism phrase.
</codex>

### Copy

- Every word earns its place. No restated headings, no intros that repeat the title.
- **No em dashes.** Use commas, colons, semicolons, periods, or parentheses. Also not `--`.
- **No aphoristic-cadence body copy as a default voice.** "Not a feature. A different architecture." / "X. No Y." / "X. Just Y." used as a recurring rhetorical pattern is the Stripe-Press / Klim cadence — once is voice, three or more times on a page is the AI-tell. If every section copy lands on a 2-3-word rebuttal sentence, rewrite. Specific, not aphoristic.
- **No SaaS buzzword strings.** "Streamline / empower / supercharge / unleash", "trusted by leading", "best-in-class / world-class / enterprise-grade / next-generation / cutting-edge", "leverage the power", "drive engagement/growth/results", "transform your business", "future-proof", "seamless experience", "game-changer", "mission-critical". Pick a specific noun and a verb that describes what the product literally does.

### The AI slop test

If someone could look at this interface and say "AI made that" without doubt, it's failed. Cross-register failures are the absolute bans above. Register-specific failures live in each reference.

**Category-reflex check.** Run at two altitudes; the second one catches what the first one misses.

- **First-order:** if someone could guess the theme + palette from the category alone ("observability → dark blue", "healthcare → white + teal", "finance → navy + gold", "crypto → neon on black"), it's the first training-data reflex. Rework the scene sentence and color strategy until the answer isn't obvious from the domain.
- **Second-order:** if someone could guess the aesthetic family from category-plus-anti-references ("AI workflow tool that's not SaaS-cream → editorial-typographic", "fintech that's not navy-and-gold → terminal-native dark mode"), it's the trap one tier deeper. The first reflex was avoided; the second wasn't. Rework until both answers are not obvious. The brand register's [reflex-reject aesthetic lanes](reference/brand.md) list catches the currently-saturated families.

### Routing rules

1. **No argument**: render the table above as the user-facing command menu, grouped by category. Ask what they'd like to do.
2. **First word matches a command**: load its reference file and follow its instructions. Everything after the command name is the target.
3. **First word doesn't match**: general design invocation. Apply the setup steps, shared design laws, and the loaded register reference, using the full argument as context.

Setup (context gathering, register) is already loaded by then; sub-commands don't re-invoke `{{command_prefix}}impeccable`.

If the first word is `craft`, setup still runs first, but [reference/craft.md](reference/craft.md) owns the rest of the flow. If setup invokes `teach` as a blocker, finish teach, refresh context, then resume the original command and target.

## Pin / Unpin

**Pin** creates a standalone shortcut so `{{command_prefix}}<command>` invokes `{{command_prefix}}impeccable <command>` directly. **Unpin** removes it. The script writes to every harness directory present in the project.

```bash
node {{scripts_path}}/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>
```

Valid `<command>` is any command from the table above. Report the script's result concisely. Confirm the new shortcut on success, relay stderr verbatim on error.
