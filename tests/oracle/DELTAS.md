# Accepted deltas

Cases listed here differ from their JS golden on purpose. Each entry names the
case id, what differs, and why it is an improvement. Nothing gets on this list
without review.

## Recorded 2026-08-17: the engine names its own commands

The JS scripts printed their own file names in usage lines, directives, and
the hook manifests they wrote. The binary prints the verb (`impeccable doctor`)
or the launcher path (`"<scripts>/impeccable" hook`). Each case below was
re-recorded from the engine after a line-level review confirmed the only change
is that wording; behavior, exit codes, and every other byte are unchanged.

- `doctor-help`, `doctor-help-short`: `Usage: node doctor.mjs …` is now `Usage: impeccable doctor [--json] [--fix] [--target <path>]`.
- `doctor-legacy-text`: the closing hint reads `Run \`<self> doctor --fix\``.
- `pin-usage-no-args`, `pin-usage-one-arg`: `Usage: impeccable pin <pin|unpin> <command>`.
- `surface-brief-usage`, `surface-brief-unknown`, `surface-brief-write-usage`: usage lines name `impeccable surface-brief`.
- `critique-usage`, `critique-unknown`: usage lines name `impeccable critique-storage`.
- `context-monorepo-target-missing`: MONOREPO_TARGET_REQUIRED says `impeccable context ran without --target`.
- `hadmin-on`, `hadmin-on-twice`, `hadmin-off-then-status`, `hadmin-on-repairs-existing-manifest`, `hadmin-on-malformed-manifest-backup`: `hooks on` writes manifests that run the launcher (`"<scripts>/impeccable" hook`, Cursor `hook-before-edit`) instead of `node "<scripts>/hook.mjs"`.
- `hook-session-fresh-then-pending-then-stop`, `hook-session-two-sessions`, `hbe-denial-downgrade-after-6`: the short footer names `impeccable hooks ignore-value`.
- `live-help`, `live-accept-help`, `live-inject-help`, `live-insert-help`, `live-server-help`, `live-resume-help`, `live-commit-help`, `live-discard-help`, `live-complete-help`, `live-complete-no-id`: usage text names `impeccable live*` verbs.
- `live-server-already-running`, `live-daemon-server-status-poll-complete`, `live-status-empty`, `live-status-generating`, `live-status-many-sessions`, `live-status-stale-server-json`, `live-status-legacy-sessions-dir`, `live-status-from-subdir`, `live-status-manual-apply`, `live-resume-manual-apply`, `live-status-mount-failed`, `live-resume-mount-failed`, `live-resume-generating`, `live-resume-by-id`, `live-resume-first-active-sorted`, `live-resume-accept-requested`, `live-resume-carbonize-required`: recovery hints and next-command lines spell `<self> live-poll` / `live-server` / `live-complete` / `live-commit-manual-edits` instead of the `.mjs` names.

## Recorded 2026-08-17: live-inject adds `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` to a CSP meta script-src

The detector the live overlay loads from the helper origin is a WebAssembly
module in the engine (its `docs/WASM-BUNDLE.md`); a `script-src` that names the
origin but not `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` still refuses to compile it. The JS
`patchCspMeta` predates the wasm bundle and appended only the origin.

- `live-inject-csp-meta-no-connect-src`: the patched `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` reads `script-src 'self' http://localhost:8412 'wasm-unsafe-eval'` (was `script-src 'self' http://localhost:8412`). The `data-impeccable-csp-original` marker, the `connect-src` and `img-src` additions, idempotence, and the revert on unpatch are unchanged. `live-inject-vite-csp-meta` and `live-inject-next-jsx` carry meta tags the patch does not touch, so their goldens did not move.

## Recorded 2026-08-31: detector-engine ports landed, gap goldens restored

The section previously here pinned the gap between main's post-freeze detector
fixes and the engine. Those fixes are now ported (engine repo commits:
`c0aa75f` oklch in visual-contrast/neon-text, upstream 1b7da15b #592;
`5cdeec8` color-mix nested hex, upstream 54440319 #578; the 1D grid fix,
upstream a236137b #615, rode along in `9046e8f` via a concurrent staging race;
`6d36231` comment stripping for regex matchers, upstream 067665cc #589 +
ddb60993 + ba873f75 + 9a7d0fbc; `33aef88` root-relative linked stylesheets,
upstream 2b88aa52 #652 + daae1d41; `6d0ecf1` URL userinfo redaction with
origin-scoped basic auth, upstream d5873ff8 + d690349d #657; `09f8ae7` inert
exact ignore-value refusal, upstream be87f5eb #662; `20c8347` the
comp-fidelity rules organic-clip-path and buried-raster, upstream 58561610).
The affected goldens were re-recorded from the fixed engine and each json
fixture golden was byte-verified against the last JS engine state in history
(`db1462b9^`, which carries both main's drift and the comp-fidelity rules):

- Moved to post-fix behavior: `detect-fixture-json-codex-grid-1d-pass-html`,
  `detect-fixture-text-codex-grid-1d-pass-html` (no finding, exit 0),
  `detect-fixture-json-organic-clip-path-html`,
  `detect-fixture-text-organic-clip-path-html`,
  `detect-fixture-json-buried-raster-html`,
  `detect-fixture-text-buried-raster-html` (the new rules fire),
  `detect-fixture-json-glow-html`, `detect-fixture-text-glow-html` (glow's
  `.photo-opaque-grad` column now carries its intended buried-raster finding),
  and the sweeps `detect-dir-json-all-fixtures`, `detect-dir-text-all-fixtures`,
  `detect-dir-quiet-all-fixtures`, `detect-no-advisory-json`,
  `detect-no-advisory-text`.
- Unchanged on re-record (already matched the fixed JS in the static engine):
  `detect-fixture-json-color-html`, `detect-fixture-text-color-html`,
  `detect-fixture-json-oklch-neon-text-html`,
  `detect-fixture-text-oklch-neon-text-html` (the oklch and color-mix fixes
  observably change the browser-side visual-contrast path, which these static
  scans do not exercise), `detect-scope-type`, `detect-scope-both`.

The frozen call vectors for `checkHtmlPatterns`
(`tests/oracle/vectors/calls/rules.checks/checkHtmlPatterns.jsonl`) were
re-recorded the same way: args untouched, results replayed through the
`db1462b9^` JS (14 of 101 moved: the comp-fidelity scans and the
comment-stripping/inline-fragment fixes to `enclosingCssSelector`). No case in
this section is an accepted delta any more; the engine matches the final JS.

## Recorded 2026-08-31: main's Aug 17-31 verb fixes ported to the engine, goldens re-recorded

The goldens below froze pre-fix behavior. Each fix landed on main in JS and
was ported to the engine; the cases were re-recorded from the binary and
reviewed line by line, so they now pin the fixed behavior.

- `hook-session-fresh-then-pending-then-stop`, `hook-session-two-sessions`: the Stop deep pass syncs the remembered set to the live scan, including findings the per-edit pass already surfaced, so a second Stop with nothing new is silent and a fixed-then-reintroduced finding fires again (upstream 3c442af7).
- `hadmin-on`, `hadmin-on-twice`, `hadmin-off-then-status`, `hadmin-on-repairs-existing-manifest`, `hadmin-on-malformed-manifest-backup`: the Claude manifests `hooks on` writes match on `Edit|Write` and the description names the current tools; Claude Code folded multi-edit behavior into Edit (upstream 7d5c60d2).
- `live-commit-mock-unreported-file-change`: the rollback-failure results share one constructor, which moved `unreportedFiles` and `notes` after `pageUrl` in the emitted JSON (upstream 1f2c3f9d).
