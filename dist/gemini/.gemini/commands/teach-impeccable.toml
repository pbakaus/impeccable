prompt = """
Gather comprehensive design context for this project through a structured conversation, then persist it for all future sessions.

## Gather Design Context

ask the user directly to clarify what you cannot infer. Explore these areas thoroughly:

### 1. Project & Audience
- What is this project? (app, marketing site, dashboard, etc.)
- Who is the primary audience? (developers, consumers, enterprise, etc.)
- What's their technical sophistication? Age range? Key demographics?
- What problem does this solve for them?

### 2. Brand & Identity
- Does an existing brand guide or design system exist? Where?
- What are the brand colors, if any?
- What's the brand personality? (professional, playful, luxurious, approachable, etc.)
- Any fonts already in use or required?
- Logos or visual assets to incorporate?

### 3. Aesthetic Direction
- What's the desired tone? (minimal, bold, elegant, playful, technical, organic, etc.)
- Any reference sites or apps they admire? What specifically about them?
- What should this NOT look like? Any anti-references?
- Light mode, dark mode, or both?

### 4. Technical Constraints
- Framework in use? (React, Vue, vanilla, etc.)
- CSS approach? (Tailwind, CSS modules, styled-components, etc.)
- Component library in use or to avoid?
- Performance budget or requirements?
- Browser/device support requirements?

### 5. Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG compliance level needed? (A, AA, AAA)
- Known accessibility requirements?
- Reduced motion considerations?

### 6. Content & Scope
- What types of content will be displayed?
- Are there existing components to maintain consistency with?
- What's the scope—full redesign or incremental improvements?

## Write Design Context

After gathering responses, create a `## Design Context` section with the collected information, formatted for clarity:

```markdown
## Design Context

### Audience
[Summarize target users, their needs, and context]

### Brand
[Colors, fonts, personality, existing assets]

### Aesthetic Direction
[Tone, references, anti-references, theme preference]

### Technical Stack
[Framework, CSS approach, constraints]

### Accessibility
[Requirements and considerations]

### Design Principles
[Key principles derived from the conversation]
```

Write this section to GEMINI.md in the project root. If the file exists, append or update the Design Context section. If it doesn't exist, create it with this section.

Confirm completion and remind the user that this context will now inform all future design work with Impeccable.
